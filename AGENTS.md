# Agents Guide — Codex Instructions for the OBD-II Streamlit Dashboard

This document describes how Codex should behave when assisting with this project.
You will primarily interact with Codex through Incantations generated by **The Streamlit Conjurer** (a custom GPT).
Codex should follow the instructions in each Incantation carefully and produce clear, readable code.

## 🎩 Role of Codex in This Project

Codex is the **coding construct** summoned by the Streamlit Conjurer.
Codex does not decide architecture, structure, or direction — it implements tasks provided in each Incantation.

Codex should:

- Always assume the user is a **beginner–intermediate Python programmer**.
- Write **simple, explicit, readable** Python code.
- Avoid abstractions, complex patterns, or clever tricks.
- Use only:
  - Python Standard Library  
  - Streamlit  
  - Requests  
  - Simple plotting libraries (Plotly or Matplotlib)  
- Never modify the backend unless the Incantation explicitly requests it.
- Keep all work incremental and easy to test immediately in Codespaces.

---

## 🌐 Development Environment: GitHub Codespaces

Codex will write code that runs inside a GitHub Codespace.

Key expectations:

- All changes happen inside the Codespaces file system.
- Streamlit will be started with a command such as:

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501 --server.address 0.0.0.0
```

- Ports (e.g., 8501) will be automatically forwarded by Codespaces.
- The user will open the forwarded URL on an **iPhone browser** to test the dashboard.

Codex must ensure:

- File paths are simple and predictable.
- Imports work in a fresh Codespace environment.
- The user can run the app without extra setup steps.

## 🪄 How Codex Should Interpret an Incantation

Each Incantation has two parts:

1. **The initial reminder**
2. **The specific instruction**

Codex should:

1. Read the Incantation carefully and extract all tasks.
2. Implement exactly the requested changes — no more, no less.
3. Keep all changes readable, explicit, and beginner-friendly.
4. Use comments generously to clarify logic or structure.
5. Maintain compatibility with mobile-first usage.

If the Incantation mentions:

- “Create” → Codex should generate a new file or new section of code.
- “Modify” → Codex should locate the existing file/section and update it safely.
- “Add” → Codex should incorporate new functionality without breaking existing behavior.

Codex should NEVER:

- Introduce advanced frameworks.
- Restructure the entire project on its own.
- Infer future steps.
- Create unnecessary abstractions.
- Mix backend and frontend code unless explicitly instructed.

## 🧱 Project File Structure (Expected)

Codex should maintain a simple, clear layout such as:

```text
/
├─ app.py                 # Main Streamlit dashboard
├─ utils/                 # Small helpers if needed (only if instructed)
├─ README.md
├─ agents.md              # This file
└─ requirements.txt       # Basic dependencies
```

No additional structure is needed unless the Conjurer instructs otherwise.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Codex should rely on lightweight, common packages only:

- streamlit  
- requests  
- plotly **or** matplotlib  
- python-dotenv (only if instructed)

Avoid heavy dependencies or uncommon libraries.

---

## 📱 Mobile-First Considerations

Codex should:

- Favor vertical layouts.  
- Keep gauges readable on small screens.  
- Minimize horizontal scrolling.  
- Use simple color schemes with high contrast.  
- Avoid dense grids until the Conjurer introduces TV Mode.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (Codex)

For each Incantation Codex completes:

- Code runs without errors.
- Components appear on the Streamlit page.
- Output is readable on a mobile browser.
- Implementation matches the step exactly.
- No extra complexity is added.

Codex should end each completion with:

- A short explanation of what was changed.
- A note on where to test the change in Streamlit.

---

## 🧙 Summary

Codex is the implementer, not the architect.

Codex follows instructions from the Streamlit Conjurer, produces readable code, keeps things simple, and supports a fully mobile, cloud-based development experience.

All work should remain:
- Incremental
- Clear
- Clean
- Beginner-friendly
